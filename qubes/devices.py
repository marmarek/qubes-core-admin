'''API for various types of devices.

Main concept is that some domain main
expose (potentially multiple) devices, which can be attached to other domains.
Devices can be of different classes (like 'pci', 'usb', etc). Each device
class is implemented by an extension.

Devices are identified by pair of (backend domain, `ident`), where `ident` is
:py:class:`str` and can contain only characters from `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]` set.

Such extension should provide:
 - `qubes.devices` endpoint - a class descendant from
 :py:class:`qubes.devices.DeviceInfo`, designed to hold device description (
 including class-specific properties)
 - handle `device-attach:class` and `device-detach:class` events for
 performing the attach/detach action; events are fired even when domain isn't
 running and extension should be prepared for this
 - handle `device-list:class` event - list devices exposed by particular
 domain; it should return list of appropriate DeviceInfo objects
 - handle `device-get:class` event - get one device object exposed by this
 domain of given identifier
 - handle `device-list-attached:class` event - list currently attached
 devices to this domain

            Fired to get a single device, given by the `ident` parameter.
            Handlers of this event should either return appropriate object of
            :py:class:`DeviceInfo`, or :py:obj:`None`. Especially should not
            raise :py:class:`exceptions.KeyError`.

            Fired to get list of currently attached devices to a VM. Handlers
            of this event should return list of devices actually attached to
            a domain, regardless of its settings.
