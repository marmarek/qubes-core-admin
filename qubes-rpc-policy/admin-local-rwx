## This file is included from all local read-write admin.* policy files 
## _in default configuration_. To allow only specific action, 
## edit specific policy file.

## Note that policy parsing stops at the first match,
## so adding anything below "$anyvm $anyvm action" line will have no effect

## Please use a single # to start your custom comments

## Add your entries here, make sure to append ",target=dom0" to all allow/ask actions
